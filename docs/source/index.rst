Psecas
==================================

Psecas (Pseudo-Spectral Eigenvalue Calculator with an Automated Solver)
is a collection of methods for solving eigenvalue problems (EVPs) using
pseudo-spectral methods. Psecas was developed for solving the kind of eigenvalue problem that often arises when a linear stability calculation is performed in astrophysical fluid dynamics. The code was introduced 
`in a MNRAS paper <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stz379/5308845>`_ where details on how it all works can be found (arxiv version can be downloaded `here <http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01403>`_).

.. note::
    This documentation is under construction, the best source of information is still
    the `Github repo <https://github.com/tberlok/psecas>`_.
